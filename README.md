# Smartwatch Data Analysis and Price Prediction  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing smartwatch features and specifications and building machine learning models to predict their prices. By exploring the relationship between smartwatch features and their impact on pricing, the project provides valuable insights into the smartwatch market.  

## Objectives  
1. **Smartwatch Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations among smartwatch features.  
2. **Price Prediction**: Develop machine learning models to accurately predict smartwatch prices based on specifications and features.  

## Key Tasks Performed  
- Collected and cleaned smartwatch data, including specifications, features, and prices.  
- Analyzed key factors influencing smartwatch pricing.  
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models for price prediction.  

## Dataset Overview  
The dataset includes the following attributes:  
- **Brand**: Manufacturer or brand of the smartwatch.  
- **Display Size**: Screen size in inches.  
- **Battery Life**: Duration of battery life on a single charge (in days).  
- **Water Resistance**: Level of water resistance (in meters).  
- **Price**: Retail price of the smartwatch.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis and modeling.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data preprocessing and manipulation.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Framework for building and evaluating machine learning models.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Tools for visualizing data trends and relationships.  

## Model Evaluation Metrics  
- **RÂ² Score**: Measures the goodness of fit of the model.  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Assesses prediction accuracy.  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Evaluates prediction error.
